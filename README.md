## README
#### Authored by user @mhubelbank.

This is a repo containing the source code and gameplay screenshots of a Java replica of the popular sliding-block puzzle mobile game [2048](https://play2048.co/). I wrote this code after my freshman year at Northeastern University; as such, it lacks the application of object-oriented design principles and algorithms which I learned shortly thereafter. However, this project nonetheless demonstrates my longstanding commitment to proper programming practices and the application of academic curricula outside the classroom. It also offers a snapshot of my early-stage-coronavirus, quarantine-boredom-induced projects :) 

For my most recent game implementation project, which uses the model-view-controller design pattern, SOLID design principles, and JUnit testing framework, see [Pyramid Solitaire](https://github.com/mhubelbank/pyramid-solitaire-game).
