## README
#### Authored by user @mhubelbank.

This is a repo containing the source code and gameplay screenshots of a Java replica of the popular sliding-block puzzle mobile game, 2048. I wrote this code after my freshman year at Northeastern University; as such, it's pretty well-documented and well-organized, but lacks the application of object-oriented design and algorithms which I learned shortly thereafter. This project demonstrates my longstanding commitment to proper programming practices and the application of academic curricula outside the classroom, and a product of my early-stage-coronavirus-induced boredom. 

For my most recent game implementation project, which uses the model-view-controller design pattern, SOLID design principles, and JUnit testing framework, see [Pyramid Solitaire](https://github.com/mhubelbank/pyramid-solitaire-game).
